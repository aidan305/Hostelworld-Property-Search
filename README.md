Create an iOS app that will obtain a list of property details from Hostelworlds production API and display them back to the end user.
https://api.m.hostelworld.com/2.1/cities/1530/properties/

Each item in the property list should contain :
- property name
- property type
- lowest price per night
- overall rating percentage
- a thumbnail image of the property if one is present

The property detail screen should contain :
- property name 
- address
- city
- country
